# ccloud\_gslb\_domain\_v1

This resource allows you to manage GSLB domains.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ccloud_gslb_domain_v1" "domain_1" {
  admin_state_up    = true
  fqdn              = "example.com"
  mode              = "ROUND_ROBIN"
  name              = "example-domain"
  project_id        = "your-project-id"
  service_provider  = "akamai"
  record_type       = "A"
  aliases           = ["www.example.com", "api.example.com"]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional) The region in which to obtain the Andromeda client. If
  omitted, the `region` argument of the provider is used. Changing this creates
  a new domain.

* `admin_state_up` - (Optional) Specifies whether the domain is administratively
  up or down. Defaults to `true`.

* `fqdn` - (Required) The fully qualified domain name managed by this GSLB
  domain.

* `mode` - (Optional) The load balancing mode for the domain. Supported values
  are `ROUND_ROBIN`, `WEIGHTED`, `GEOGRAPHIC`, and `AVAILABILITY`. Defaults to
  `ROUND_ROBIN`.

* `name` - (Optional) The name of the GSLB domain.

* `project_id` - (Optional) The ID of the project this domain belongs to. This
  field is computed if not set. Changes to this field will trigger a new
  resource.

* `service_provider` - (Optional) The service provider for the GSLB domain.
  Supported values are `akamai` and `f5`. Defaults to `akamai`.

* `record_type` - (Optional) The type of DNS record for the domain. Supported
  values are `A`, `AAAA`, `CNAME`, and `MX`. Defaults to `A`.

* `aliases` - (Optional) A list of aliases (additional domain names) that are
  managed by this GSLB domain.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` -  The ID of the domain.
* `cname_target` -  The CNAME target for the GSLB domain.
* `provisioning_status` -  The provisioning status of the domain.
* `status` -  The operational status of the domain.
* `created_at` -  The timestamp when the domain was created.
* `updated_at` -  The timestamp when the domain was last updated.

## Import

Domains can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```hcl
$ terraform import ccloud_gslb_domain_v1.domain_1 f0f599a9-3a0d-4b4c-88d2-40c4fb071bba
```
