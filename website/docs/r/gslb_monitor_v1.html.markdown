# ccloud\_gslb\_monitor\_v1

This resource allows you to manage GSLB Monitors.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ccloud_gslb_monitor_v1" "monitor_1" {
  admin_state_up = true
  interval       = 10
  name           = "example-monitor"
  pool_id        = "your-pool-id"
  project_id     = "your-project-id"
  receive        = "HTTP 200 OK"
  send           = "/health"
  timeout        = 5
  type           = "HTTP"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional) The region in which to obtain the Andromeda client. If
  omitted, the `region` argument of the provider is used. Changing this creates
  a new monitor.

* `admin_state_up` - (Optional) Specifies whether the monitor is
  administratively up or down. Defaults to `true`.

* `interval` - (Optional) The time, in seconds, between sending probes to
  members.

* `name` - (Optional) The name of the monitor.

* `pool_id` - (Optional) The ID of the pool that this monitor is associated
  with.

* `project_id` - (Optional) The ID of the project this monitor belongs to. This
  field is computed if not set. Changes to this field will trigger a new
  resource.

* `receive` - (Optional) The expected response text from the monitored resource.
  Valid only for `TCP` monitor types.

* `send` - (Optional) The HTTP request method and path that the monitor sends to
  the monitored resource.

* `timeout` - (Optional) Maximum time, in seconds, the monitor waits to receive
  a response from the monitored resource. This field is computed if not set.

* `type` - (Optional) The type of monitor, which determines the method used to
  check the health of the monitored resource. Supported types are `ICMP`,
  `HTTP`, `HTTPS`, `TCP`, and `UDP`. Defaults to `ICMP`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments listed above, the following computed attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the monitor.
* `provisioning_status` - The provisioning status of the monitor.
* `created_at` - The time when the monitor was created.
* `updated_at` - The time when the monitor was last updated.

## Import

Monitors can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```hcl
$ terraform import ccloud_gslb_monitor_v1.monitor_1 de731802-f092-496d-9508-9e02eb6ba0b1
```
