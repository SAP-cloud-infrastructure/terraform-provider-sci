# ccloud\_arc\_job\_v1

Use this data source to get the ID and other attributes of an Arc Job.

## Example Usage

### Get Arc Job using a Job ID

```hcl
resource "ccloud_automation_run_v1" "run_1" {
  automation_id = "123"
  selector      = "@metadata_name = 'hostname'"
}

data "ccloud_arc_job_v1" "job_1" {
  job_id = "${ccloud_automation_run_v1.run_1.jobs[0]}"
}
```

### Get Arc Job using a filter

```hcl
data "ccloud_arc_agent_v1" "agent_1" {
  filter  = "@metadata_name = 'hostname'"
}

data "ccloud_arc_job_v1" "job_1" {
  agent_id = "${data.ccloud_arc_agent_v1.agent_1.id}"
  timeout  = 3600
  agent    = "chef"
  action   = "zero"
  status   = "complete"
}
```
