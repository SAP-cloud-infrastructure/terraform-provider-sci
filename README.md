=======================================================

Documentation: [registry.terraform.io](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/sapcc/ccloud/latest/docs)

Maintainers

This provider plugin is maintained by:

  * [@kayrus](https://github.com/kayrus)
  * [@bugroger](https://github.com/BugRoger)

Requirements
------------

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 1.0.x
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.24 (to build the provider plugin)

Usage
---------------------

The CCloudEE provider is an extension to the [OpenStack Terraform
Provider](https://github.com/terraform-provider-openstack/terraform-provider-openstack).
It provides resources that allow to use Terraform for Converged Cloud's
additional services:

  * Kubernikus (Kubernetes as a Service)
  * Arc for Arc resources management
  * Lyra for Automation management
  * Billing for Billing management
  * Andromeda for GSLB / GTM (Global Server Load Balancing / Global Traffic Management)
  * Archer for Endpoint Services

The provider needs to be configured with the proper OpenStack credentials
before it can be used. For details see the OpenStack provider.

---------------------

Clone the repository

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:sapcc/terraform-provider-ccloud
```

Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```sh
$ cd terraform-provider-ccloud
$ make build
```
